This is an desktop client for cross-posting my personal notes from my private database to Twitter.

This allows me to publish my thoughts where the general public is accustomed to seeing them, while maintaining personal ownership over my data.

It's built on Electron, using React.

It's not really useful at all to anyone else. I haven't done any work to abstract users or use cases beyond posting individual tweets, maybe containing media, to my personal firebase instance, and my personal twitter account.

It is predominately used for publishing content to my personal site: https://www.ratticusscript.com

There's also a React Native mobile app which borrows all the logic.

I might abstract that part into a Lambda function.
